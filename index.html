	<p>Sometimes I'm a walking/talking paradox. I'm a shy extrovert with a love of spontaneity and a career in media planning. I treasure creative outlets but also appreciate when there is a single, solid solution to a given problem. I enjoy travel but am so easily affected by motion sickness that I once experienced nausea on a playground swing. I need 8 hours of sleep but feel the most alive late at night. After majoring in English to avoid all things structural and logical, I currently spend my 9-5s knee-deep in mathematical excel sheets (and my 5-9s trying to get a good grip on this whole coding thing).</p>

	<p>When I think about it, mostly everything has seemingly contradictory qualities to them. Coding, for example, could not thrive without its creator thinking outside of the box and utilizing fresh, unique methodologies to produce an optimal result. However, at the same time, there are set-in-stone rules and regulations that will disrupt the code and hinder the ideal end product if certain cadences are incorrectly implemented. It's with this in mind that I am optimistically embarking on this almost-impossible pathway, that even with little to no exposure to this challenging field, I can begin to fully comprehend the ins and outs of web development and successfully nurture my growth in this realm.</p>
